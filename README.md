The Mayor Monkey is a new hero you can get with some cool images and a full 20 levels. At base level, this hero throws a cash bag at bloons, which make money everytime they fire. This hero specializes in giving all kinds of nice buffs to your monkeys like discounts and stat boosts. It has 3 abilities unlocked at level 3, 10, and 20. Since this hero is basically a jack-of-all trades, it recieves Hero XP 2x slower than ANY other hero, so keep that in mind. Enjoy having the mayor of Monkeytown assist you in your bloon popping problems.



# The Daisy Tower + Zion Hero 

(yes there is no image for this LOL)

This is my first ever mod created for BTD6, and probably one of my favorites. This mod gives you access to Daisy, a wizard monkey tower capable of doing basically anything. At her last level, she gets about 20+ attacks for maximum dps (and lag). She is very unbalanced, and I'm not going to change her so keep that in mind. The hero added is called the Zion Hero, which is basically Daisy if she was a hero. The Zion Hero basically just gets stronger and stronger as the rounds progress, getting more and more attacks added to the arsenal. The Zion Hero has 2 abilities unlocked at level 3 and level 10, and level 20 shreds through anything. Another unbalanced tower so use at your own risk. This is just for the memes, but to be honest, I didn't even do that bad :)
